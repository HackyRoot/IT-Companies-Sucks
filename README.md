#  Before you Judge, There is also exception to the rule

Hi! I'm Meet Patel , A JavaScript Devloper working as full day old boring 9-5 wala JOB. Recentlty I was researching into how different companies works corporately and pay to JOBs holders and it just really sucks for employees. So, I just wann a open eyes to all new comer developers and existing one to think about this !

~~You get what you deserve~~, **You get what you snatch or ask for.** 

### Here a thing i found really bad and should be changed :(

- Knowledge is judged by years of exeperience or based on degree (with reputed university badge!) .
-  A person without technically experties leads the project managment leaving behind real deserve technical experts.
- "Positions" - like intern vs junior vs senior.
- 9 to 5 time (or 40 hours of week).
-  Salary base approach over Task base or project base income to employee !
- Overtime Bonus or Incentives to attraction.
- Stop Calling **"Resources"** - they are human being not a resource.
-  Work From Home (humans need a life !!)
- Complete the hours (even if task/project has completed)
- X more valuable than Y, beacase X is doing same thing as Y does with less salary!
- Make fake Friend/Team and do show off to impress that company is growing.
- Add fake reviews on glassdoors to hide **"real bad reviews"**
- Fire the employee when he/she seems not useful to company anymore.
- **"employee of the month"** or **"employee of the year"** - this is a company not a sports game. 
- more to come ... or **"Open a PR"**
